2a1 solution
There are 15 classes in java implementation, I abstract them into 5 process. they are Producer, Belt,Scanner,Robot and Consumer. there is only one belt, so after the bag is cleaned by scanner,the bag must move  to the the belt again when the third segment is empty.A deadlock occurs when the model is executed in the path produceSuspiciousBag ->move->produceSuspiciousBag->move->foundSuspiciousBag->move->produceNormalBag->getSuspicious->clean->pushCleanedBagLeaveScanner.that is, if there is a cleaned bag waiting to move back to the belt in scanner,meanwhile,there is a suspicious being found in the third segment  waiting to move to the scanner, but the  scanner is not empty. so the system  become deadlock.Before model this solution in FSP. this problem is also found when I implement the java project. using LTSA to check it can help us find the why the model become deadlock

2a2 solution
in order to deal with the problem occurred in 2a1 solution. I add a new belt to let the cleaned bag is moved to it instead of being moving to main belt. in FSP model. I asbeact 6 process. I add a new Scanner belt and modify the robot to make the cleaned move to the new scanner belt instead of the main belt to deal with the problems occurred  in 2a1 solution. I do not find any deadlock in both FSP model and java code. and the FSP can run as predicted step.

FSP is very useful to model the project, and using LTSA can help us find the errors that this model have. for 2a2, solution,  I do not  find any deadlock,but I can not say that the 2a2 solution is absolutely right without any problem even if there is no any deadlock checking in LTSA. It is possible that the safety properties  is not complete to find it.
